Was going to order the ribs, but a large family came in before me and got the rest of it. Luckily, I got one of the last meatloafs that they had left. It was a bit pricier than I thought it would be, but I guess it made sense for organic ingredients. They actually ran out of space to eat because they were so crowded. Dave, the manager, was really nice about it and wrapped up my food in foil to go.  I was thinking, boy, this better be worth it because this cost me $13! Well, let me say, I normally can't stand meatloaf, but I would eat this one any time of the week! It was the best meatloaf I had ever had in my life! The mashed potatoes were also amazing and the gravy had a Rosemary flavor. The Mac and cheese was completely delicious! Even the drink (some sort of organic soda), was outstanding!  Bottom line: Definitely recommend this place.

The owner welcomed us but seemed to get super impatient with me (I wanna try everything and not sure how to order that, so shoot me). But nevermind that. It's the food that really left me shrugging. Mac & Cheese: bland and more curdy than creamy/cheesy Pulled Pork: actually pretty tasty, though a little fatty and chewy, best with the mustard sauce (the spicy is not actually spicy) Chicken Pot Pie: So runny there was literally at least 1/8-1/4 cup of water at the bottom of the tin and the filling was bland White gravy: supposedly it had sage and other spices in it? I found it to be bland Corn: pretty tasty, especially when added to the mashed potatoes or other items Apple Crisp: cloyingly sweet Biscuit: small, tasteless, sad (I'm a biscuit FIEND) What I do love is that I didn't feel like I had just eaten a tub of used frying oil (as one can sometimes feel after eating low-quality comfort food). But the seasoning, spices, texture, and the execution of the dishes, were just totally lacking for me.  Maybe I just came on an off day. Or maybe I've been spoiled by southern food elsewhere.

I've never seen this with black beans which are my favorite bean. There was a nice hit of heat, some red peppers and little chunks of pork. So. Good. The pepper biscuit was also very good. The stinker of the plate was the coleslaw. I found the cabbage to be cut too thick for my taste and not enough mayo and/or seasoning.

Owner is into it though and passionate about what he's doing. \u00a0Friendly staff, cleaned up what I'm sure was a real dump and made it clean, bright and cheerful. \u00a0Boylan sodas and interesting teas but if you just want ice water they give you a 4 oz. sippy cup.

Menu is maybe 1/4 of Tom's - four entrees, maybe six sides, one dessert. \u00a0Really disappointing that they didn't have any veggies. \u00a0I do love me some greens, okra (which is in season and he ought to be cooking), and green beans Southern style. \u00a0They did have perhaps the world's most tasteless cole slaw though. \u00a0Mac and Cheese dry and stiff (that'll happen on a steam table) - not creamy and cheesy at all. \u00a0I can't imagine what the mashed potatoes are like. \u00a0I had the meatloaf - big serving which I actually managed to take a bite of smothered in mystery gravy. \u00a0Just flavorless with a too sweet topping. \u00a0She had the brisket - best thing of the day - today's special. \u00a0Pretty darned good but a pretty small portion but that's OK we weren't looking for half a cow. \u00a0Prices are quite reasonable though.

That's not a selling point to me but I appreciate it because he is socially conscious of his food. I ordered the meatloaf, rasta corn and Mac and cheese. My wife went with the chicken pot pie, mashed potatoes and chocolate pie. All the food was fantastic and cooked with care. They also have a soda machine that focuses on cane sugar sodas as opposed to the corn syrup stuff that most of us drink. Even their silverware is compostable. For all the food it cost us 23$.

The owner is a really cool, personable guy who loves what he does. Not only does he love what he does, but he is good at it. Running the entire operation on his own, he is able to cook up some of the best home style \"comfort food\" I've ever had on the road. I got a generous portion meatloaf that exceeded my expectations with some classic home-made mashed potatoes. My buddy got the pulled pork sandwich and enjoyed every bite as well. Was a bit disappointed that they were out of Mac n Cheese, but that's what you get for going with less than a half hour before close. I also appreciated the local bottling company for fountain drinks and teas. Will definitely stop back there next time I'm in Denver.

I will dream of this food for years to come... no joke. We got there at about 7:00pm and they were out of several options (I guess it's a once they run out, it's gone, kind of thing), but what we had was incredible. I had a pulled pork sandwhich that was to die for!! The pork was so tender and juicy and bursting with delicious bbq flavor. I chose to get mine as a sandwhich and the bun they put it on was soft and delicious. They piled on so much meat that I had leftovers for lunch the next day! Mom had the meatloaf and said it was quite possibly the best meat loaf she's had in her 65 years of life! Only complaint she had was that they didn't have ketchup available. She likes ketchup on her meatloaf, what can I say? But in spite of that she still loved it. We both had mashed potatoes with brown gravy as our sides and they were \u00a0glorious. Homemade and creamy mashed potatoes and perfect gravy. Honestly the best \u00a0brown gravy I've ever had. They have Boylan Bottling soda which is excellent and you can add on a glass for just a dollar. I guess it's a Colorado thing because I've never seen it anywhere but in Colorado. \u00a0It's made with real cane sugar! The bisuit/roll that came with our meals didn't have much flavor and seemed a little dry, but who cares?! Everything else was so incredible that i could have cared less about a mediocre biscuit. My mom and I were awed by this place and so happy that all the great reviews stood true. It makes me want to to cry that I live 10 hours away from it and probably wont eat here again for a long time. But you better believe that this will be a staple of any future Denver visits that I make from here on out. I want to try some of their other dishes so bad!!

Well, at least the way in which the owner tries to source locally and organic as much as possible, it helps that the food there is very tasty as well. They even have an awesome selection of fountain drinks provided through a Fountain Soda machine from Boylan Bottling Company. The cafe and the soda company share the same mission of providing quality products of which I am thankful for and appreciate. My understanding is that the menu is not static but rather changes with the seasons (dynamic). This keeps costs down for the cafe and that is passed on to the consumer. I rather like that kind of variety in a restaurant and it stays true to buying things as local as possible. They offer plenty for the varied diet and do well with each food item, tasty all around.

Mac and cheese really good and the mash potatoes were good but somewhat not a fan of sage with mash potatoes/gravy. \u00a0I found the tones of Sage distracting the flavor of the gravy. The baked beans were just average. I prefer pinto beans over black beans because they are more tender. Beans seemed to be slightly undercooked. They do a good job with their KC BBQ sauce.
